          This page belongs to an independent distributor and runs on Suppli Afya. Here is, in plain words, what happens to
          what you tell it.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2 className="font-display text-[1.5rem] text-ink">Help me choose</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Your answers are used in your browser to suggest products, and are kept there only until you close the tab. They
            are shared with the distributor only if you choose to send them, by tapping the WhatsApp button at the end. If the
            distributor uses a Suppli Afya workspace, sending also saves your answers and suggestions there, so they can help you.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 className="font-display text-[1.5rem] text-ink">Orders</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            When you send an order, it opens in WhatsApp with the products, your name and the delivery details you entered, and
            the distributor receives it when you press send. The distributor may keep a record of it to deliver and to follow
            up. This page remembers what&apos;s in your order, your name and your delivery choice on this device, so you
            don&apos;t have to type them again. Clearing your browser&apos;s data removes them.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 className="font-display text-[1.5rem] text-ink">Payments</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            You pay the distributor directly. This page never asks for card numbers or M-Pesa PINs, and doesn&apos;t take
            payments.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 className="font-display text-[1.5rem] text-ink">Your rights</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Under Kenya&apos;s Data Protection Act, you can ask to see, correct or delete information held about you. Ask the
            distributor directly, or contact the Suppli Afya team.
