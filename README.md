# Suppli Afya distributor storefront

A distributor's own page, where their customers get help choosing products, see prices, and order.
Kate Cromuel's storefront is the first one and the reference for every other distributor.

A customer arriving from WhatsApp, Instagram or a QR card should know within seconds: whose page this
is, that they can get help choosing, that they can simply browse, what things cost, and how to order.

```
Kate's identity  →  "What would you like help with?" (up to three interests, or none)
                 →  the selector (the Suppli Afya recommendation engine), starting from those interests
                 →  suggestions, with the reason and the price
                 →  the catalogue → product details → order
                 →  the order, placed with Kate or written into WhatsApp for her to confirm
```

It is part of Suppli Afya ([suppli_afya](https://github.com/eddienjeru564-ship-it/suppli_afya)): the
same engine, the same safety rules, the same voice. Suppli Afya appears only as "Powered by" in the footer.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000 (Kate's storefront; also at /kate)
npm test               # storefront logic, config validation, and the engine's own tests
npm run typecheck && npm run lint
npm run build && npx playwright test   # end-to-end on desktop and a phone, including 360px screens
SCREENSHOTS=1 npx playwright test e2e/screenshots.spec.ts   # review screenshots in test-results/screens/
```

## How it's put together

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/engine/` | The recommendation engine: an **exact copy** of `suppli_afya/src/engine`, never edited here (see below) |
| `src/storefronts/` | One file per distributor (`kate.ts`) and the registry (`index.ts`) |
| `src/storefront/` | Pure logic: types, prices and order, product facts, messages, config validation. Tested |
| `src/components/StorefrontPage.tsx` | The page, in story order |
| `src/components/sections/` | Top bar, hero, "What would you like help with?", how it works, catalogue, ordering, meet your distributor, closing, mobile bar |
| `src/components/selector/` | The selector overlay (drives the engine), the live "What you've told us" panel, results |
| `src/components/product/` | Product photos and pack illustrations (`PackArt`), product card, product sheet, quantity controls |
| `src/components/order/` | The order sheet: review → your details → send |
| `src/components/whatsapp/` | Every chat with the distributor goes through here |
| `src/components/store/` | Page state: the order, overlays (kept in the URL), selector session, toasts |
| `src/components/ui/` | Buttons, icons, the sheet primitive |
| `src/app/api/` | `leads` (forwards selector results to the Suppli Afya app), `orders` (re-prices, files orders in the Suppli Afya portal, optional webhook) and `cron/orders` (sends orders still waiting) |
| `src/server/` | The storefront's own database and schema, and filing orders in the portal (`portal.ts`) |
| `e2e/` | Playwright: both customer paths, safety, links and the back button, small phones, the order API |
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | The design system and why each screen looks the way it does |
| `docs/LAUNCH.md` | What Kate needs to give us before her page goes live |

### The engine is not edited here

`src/engine/` is copied byte for byte from the Suppli Afya app and pinned in `engine.lock.json`
(upstream commit and a hash per file). `npm test` fails if any engine file changes locally. To change
the engine, change it in `suppli_afya`, then:

```bash
npm run engine:sync                        # from ../suppli_afya
npm run engine:sync -- --from <checkout>   # or from another checkout
npm run engine:check                       # verify
```

What this repo builds around the engine, and what it reuses:

- The selector's driving logic follows `suppli_afya/src/components/check/HealthCheck.tsx`
  (next/back/finish, auto-advance, validation, answers in sessionStorage). Two presentation changes:
  the page itself replaces the engine's welcome screen (the privacy and "not medical advice" screen is
  still the first thing and still has to be accepted), and section screens become a header on the next
  question. Same words, four fewer taps.
- The answer inputs are ported from `components/check/inputs.tsx` with the same roles and behaviour.
- Results use the engine's output as it is: "because you said" reasons, cautions, honest expectations,
  what was left out and why, habits, see-a-doctor notes. The storefront adds prices and ordering.
- "Send to Kate on WhatsApp" uses the engine's own `whatsappMessage`, and the lead goes to the app's
  existing `/api/leads` contract, so it lands in the distributor's portal like any health check.

## Adding a distributor

1. Copy `src/storefronts/kate.ts` to `src/storefronts/<name>.ts` and fill it in: name, role, area,
   WhatsApp number, their colour (`theme`), their prices (`catalogue.offers`, keyed by engine product id),
   delivery areas and payment methods. Leave anything unconfirmed out, or list it in `pending`.
2. Add it to `STOREFRONTS` in `src/storefronts/index.ts`. It's served at `/<slug>`.
3. `npm test`. Validation catches unknown product ids, prices that aren't whole shillings, featured
   products that aren't for sale, a WhatsApp number in the wrong format, and an accent colour that white
   text can't sit on.

No component mentions a distributor by name; a test enforces it. When distributors manage their page
from the Suppli Afya portal, `storefrontBySlug` in `src/storefronts/index.ts` is the one place that changes.

## Preview and live

`status: "preview"` lists what's still a placeholder in a quiet note at the foot of the page, keeps the
page out of search engines, and never opens a chat: every WhatsApp button shows the exact message instead.
`status: "live"` requires a WhatsApp number and an empty `pending` list (validation enforces both).

## Ordering and payments

Suppli Afya doesn't take customers' money (the main repo's `docs/BRAIN.md`: collecting payments on
behalf of distributors raises licensing questions; per-distributor M-Pesa requests are Phase 3). So an
order is complete and priced on the page, and the customer chooses how to send it:

- **Place order** (the main button): the server re-prices it and files it in the distributor's Suppli
  Afya portal (`POST <SUPPLI_AFYA_URL>/api/storefront/orders`, signed with `STOREFRONT_SECRET`,
  idempotent on the reference). It appears on their Today list as "<name> ordered from your page", with
  a confirmation message ready to send. The customer adds a phone number so the distributor can reach
  them. Needs a live storefront with `suppliSlug`; a preview shows the confirmation and files nothing.
- **Send it on WhatsApp**: the same order, written into a chat with a reference (`KC-7QX2`).

Either way the distributor confirms stock, delivery and the total, and the customer pays them directly.
The order sheet remembers the customer's details on their phone and offers "Order the same again" next
time.

## Product photos

Put official BF Suma photos of the exact pack in `assets/products/<product-id>.<ext>`, record where each
came from in `assets/products/sources.json`, and run `npm run photos`. See `assets/products/README.md`.
19 of the 29 products have one; the rest keep their drawn pack. Every product, photo or drawing, stands
on the same white stage: in the catalogue, the product sheet, suggestions, the order and the hero.
Products with a photo are listed right after the featured ones, and the link preview shows the first
three.

What each pack holds ("60 capsules") comes from the engine's catalogue (`pack`, read off these
photos) and is shown under every price. A storefront's `offer.pack` overrides it.

Orders sent on WhatsApp are filed in the portal too when the customer gave a phone number (live storefronts
with a `suppliSlug`), so every order lands in the distributor's Orders and on Today and reorder reminders
work (`src/server/portal.ts`). If the portal can't take an order right away, it waits in this storefront's own
database and is sent again the next time the portal answers, or by the morning job (`/api/cron/orders`). It's
deleted once filed, and after 7 days regardless. The portal files each reference once, so a placed order the
customer also sends on WhatsApp still appears once.

## Configuration

See `.env.example`.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Public URL, for link previews and share links. On Vercel it defaults to the deploy's own address |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_STOREFRONT` | Which storefront `/` shows (default: the first) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPLI_AFYA_SITE` | Where "Powered by Suppli Afya" links (default `https://suppliafya.co.ke`) |
| `SUPPLI_AFYA_URL` | The Suppli Afya app. Selector results are filed as prospects (`/api/leads`) and orders in the portal (`/api/storefront/orders`); live storefronts with `suppliSlug` only |
| `STOREFRONT_SECRET` | Shared with the app (same value there). Orders are only filed with it |
| `DATABASE_URL` | This storefront's own database, holding orders waiting for the portal. Optional; see "Deploying" |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Protects `/api/cron/orders`, which sends waiting orders every morning (see `vercel.json`) |
| `ORDER_WEBHOOK_URL` | Each order, re-priced on the server, is POSTed here as JSON (a sheet, a channel) |

## Deploying

The Vercel project is `suppli-afya-distributor-template`, linked to
`eddienjeru564-ship-it/suppli_afya-distributor_template`. `vercel.json` runs its functions in Dublin
(`dub1`), next to its own Supabase project.

- **Its Supabase project is `suppli_afya-distributor_template`** (ref `vpnkhgsgkhsevtrgfbbg`, Ireland,
  `eu-west-1`). It holds one table, `pending_orders`: orders waiting for the portal, deleted once filed or after
  7 days. The storefront creates it on first connect from `src/server/schema.ts`.
- **Its own database user.** The storefront connects as `storefront_app`, not `postgres`, through the transaction
  pooler (port 6543, which Vercel needs). Copy the host from Supabase → Connect → Transaction pooler:
  `postgres://storefront_app.vpnkhgsgkhsevtrgfbbg:PASSWORD@aws-0-eu-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require`.
  Don't add `?pgbouncer=true` (a Prisma setting; Postgres rejects it).
  It owns its tables and can't bypass row level security. Every table has RLS on with no policies and Supabase's
  Data API roles hold no grants, so nothing is readable through the API; `src/server/portal.test.ts` checks this.
  To rotate the password: `alter role storefront_app password '…'` in the SQL editor, then update `DATABASE_URL`
  in Vercel and redeploy.
- **Never connect this storefront to the main app's database** (`suppli_afya-main_site`). The storefront reaches
  the app only through its public API, at `SUPPLI_AFYA_URL`.
